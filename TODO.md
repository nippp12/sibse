# TODO: GitHub Workflow Fix for Flux Authentication

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated `.github/workflows/lint.yml` to conditionally handle Flux authentication
- [x] Updated `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to conditionally handle Flux authentication  
- [x] Created comprehensive README.md with Flux setup documentation

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHub Workflows
Both workflow files now:
- Check if Flux credentials are available in GitHub secrets
- Only attempt authentication when credentials exist
- Skip Flux package installation gracefully when credentials are missing
- Provide clear console output about the status

### 2. Documentation
- Added detailed README.md with installation instructions
- Included sections for both scenarios: with and without Flux access
- Added GitHub secrets configuration instructions

## Testing Required
- Test the workflows with Flux credentials available
- Test the workflows without Flux credentials
- Verify that both scenarios work correctly

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml`
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
- `README.md` (created)

The solution ensures that:
1. Your original workflows continue to work when you have Flux credentials
2. Other users can use the repository without Flux credentials
3. GitHub Actions won't fail due to missing authentication
4. Clear documentation is provided for both scenarios
